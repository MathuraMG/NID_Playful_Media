# Game Design - Playful Media
* Oct 6 - Oct 17 - 10:00am - 1:30pm
* Email : mathura@papercranelab.com
* Class repo : https://github.com/MathuraMG/NID_Playful_Media

# Course Overview
The first half of the course focuses on understanding the fundamentals of computation, its language and programming the computer (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects), mainly through the p5.js programming framework.
The second half focuses on applying fundamental programming concepts to generate and manipulate various media, including visuals, imagery, sound, text and data and interactions.
The course will conclude with a student-driven mini project where they will apply the learnings and create an interactive work on their own.
No programming experience required to attend this course.

# Learning Objectives :
## Conceptual understanding
* History of computation and arts/design
  * Drawing
  * Visuals
  * Animation
  * Games 
  * Product design
* Appreciate and understand Computational Aesthetics / Expressive power of computers
* Characteristics of the digital medium.
* Procedurality / Rule-based systems
* Understand Interactivity

# Technical skills
* Ability to read and write code (in P5.js or any other platform/language)
* Computational thinking/thinking in code
* Ability to create visual animations and interactive media through code.

# Creative process
* Develop and apply design sensibilities in creating computational media forms 
* Appreciate and understand code as a material

üéâ **Special Mention** üéâ- We will be discussing AI! As a tool, as a material, as an actor, and as an ethical dilemma! Given the present scenario of tech - this thread of discussion will run through the course.


# Assignments:
Every class you will have an assignment. Some of the time it will be reading, some of the time it will be practical.

Each week lab there‚Äôs a ‚Äúwalk-through‚Äù element that will be covered in class, which you are expected to do on your own, and an improvisational aspect, where you take the lesson and make something unique and interesting based on the in-class review. We will spend time in each class reviewing your work, and using this as an opportunity to review concepts that are unclear, or investigate solutions to common problems. Expect to be asked to show your work every time we meet. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work, other classes only a few students may, but always be prepared.

All of your work must be documented on your Github repository. Instructions will be given in class.

Project documentation: You are expected to document your work on your Github repository. The purpose of this is twofold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate to me that you are keeping up with the work in the class. I read the site to see how you are doing. At a minimum, reference to your work is expected, as well as reference to the readings, and thorough documentation of any research. Secondly, it is a way to document your work for your own use and that of others.

You must update your repository daily with the work you have done for class.

Document your projects thoroughly as you go; don‚Äôt put it off until the end. Photos, video, drawings, schematics, and notes are all valuable forms of documentation. Explain the project at the beginning of your documentation, so that people who come to your site from outside this class can understand your work quickly.

Always cite the sources of your code, the places you learned techniques from, and the inspirations of your ideas. Copying code or techniques without attribution is plagiarism. Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.

Good documentation should include a description and illustration of your project. You should include what it looks like, what it does, what the user or participant does in response. When it‚Äôs interactive, mention and show what the user does. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who‚Äôs never seen the project can understand it.

You should also include a section describing how the project works, aimed at a more informed reader (your instructor, or next year‚Äôs classmates). 

Here is an example of good weekly documentation:


The writing is expected to be well reasoned, grammatically correct, and written as if it were a paper being turned in. You should link to any relevant sources, and provide as much context as you can using images, video, audio, or other forms of expression. 
We'll work on setting up a github account on day 1!

# Participation
Sustained participation that demonstrates thoughtful engagement with the course materials is an important requirement in this class.
Active participation provides both you and your classmates greater opportunities to learn from one another.
Ways to Participate ***During Class***
  * Be present, attentive, and mindful.
  * Contribute to class discussions by raising questions, supporting/challenging points of interest, offering feedback to other student‚Äôs ideas, making connections to examples and material across the program, and sharing relevant personal experiences and perspectives.
  * Share assignment work. This includes a working website, a website that kind of works but not the way you expected, a website that did work but doesn‚Äôt anymore, and so on. Basically, don‚Äôt be afraid to volunteer to show what you did or tried to do even if it is not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. Explaining your work to other people is one of the best ways to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus, showing work that falls short of your goals is not a sign of failure, it is an opportunity to learn and grow.
    - Provide constructive feedback to other student‚Äôs project work and presentations.

If you have any concerns about expectations for participation, please do communicate the same with me at the earliest.

# Laptops:
Laptop use is fine if you are using your laptop to present in class, or if we‚Äôre in the middle of an exercise that makes use of it. Whenever classmates are presenting or we‚Äôre in the midst of a class discussion, please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect that and close your lid.

# Mobile Phones:
Do not use your phone in class unless it is part of the lesson or it is an emergency.

# Accessibility
Please feel free to make suggestions to me about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you.
