---------

Uses:
"Traditional" vs "Media" 
What does this mean to you?

-------------------

-------------------

Using the computer as a raw material, a medium for creation, rather than just a "tool"

---------

What makes it different from paints and a paintbrush?

Side note - It's interdisciplinary!

-------------------

What do you think is the role of the computer/code in gaming?

-------------------

It needs to
- have a meaningful interaction
- be made with code
- BONUS : an insightful story/message

-------------------

Next 2 weeks
- Look at code as a medium
- Create systems using code 
- Understand how we can "game" with code (Looking beyond video games, experiences etc)
- Realise what we win/lose in terms of experience as we explore this medium

-------

To start working with a medium, we need to first understand the medium - its characteristics, strenghts, weaknesses
