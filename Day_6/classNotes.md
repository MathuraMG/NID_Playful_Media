* Classes and Objects

## Objects
  * What is an object?
    * It is an entity, with properties (attributes or functions)
    * Eg - let's take the car - it has a startingX, startingY, a colour, a size etc.
    * **DEMO** Make a car object
    * Now you could even define how this object is drawn as well
    * But we still have the issue that if we need to make multiple car objects, we have to do this each time!
    * So we will Ã§reate a class <- a blueprint of how to make a car!

## Classes and Objects
  * **TODO** Let's create a car class!
  * Create a new object using the car class
  * Make an array of cars!

## TRY THIS
* Create a class "Flower"
* Flower should have the following functions
  * draw
  * sway
  * grow (BONUS)
* Your sketch should be able to do the following
  * Create a flower at mouseX and mouseY when you click the mouse on the canvas
  * If user drags the mouse across the canvas, all the flowers should sway ( you can implement the sway functionality either using random or noise
  * The flower grows over time
  * BONUS : Only the flowers close to the mouse sway when you drag the mouse
