# Day 2 - 7th Oct 2025
## Class Plan

* Github and markdown [Github for documentation](https://github.com/MathuraMG/Resources/blob/main/Github-for-documentation.md) | [Markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/)

# What is this class about?
* DISCUSSION | How has animation and interaction changed the nature of games and art?
  
* Github recap
  * how to publish your repo
  * Documentation and markdown

* Animation and variables
  * inbuilt and custom variables
  * animation with events and event function
  * key and mouse interactions
  * if statement

## Variables
* What is a variable?
  * A variable contains values that are subject to change
  * We can create variables of our own, but first lests take a look at variables given to us by p5. These are refered to as inbuild variables.
  * `mouseX` and `mouseY` contain the values of the x position and y position of the mouse respectively.

* Custom variables
  * In many cases we will want to create out own variables to store values. The syntax to do that is `let variableName = InitialValue;`
  * Creating a variable using `let variableName` is also known as declaring a variable. If you chose to give it a value WHEN declaring, that is known as initilising.
  * Note: You may see some videos/references that use `var` instead of `let`. That is the older way of doing it.
  * If you declare a variable outside of setup and draw, it is known as a global variable, it can be accessed anywhere
  * If you declare it inside one of these functions, it can be used only within that function
  * Why do we need variables?
    * reusability 
    * changing the values

* Interaction and animation in p5
  * You can use the variables to create some simple animations.

# ASSIGNMENT
Recreate MS Paint - how would you do it differently, and why?
