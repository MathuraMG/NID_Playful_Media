**Recap**
* functions - let's make a simple one that draws flowers
* functions - mousePressed, mouseDragged, keyPressed
* angleMode

**Topics covered in class**

## Functions
* Use other p5 functions to create interactivity
## Conditionals
  * You would use a conditional (if-else) when you want certain blocks of code to run only when a certain condition is satisfied
  * Syntax is as follows
  ```
  if(customCondition) {
    //What code to run if the condition is satisfied
  }
  else {
    //What code to run if the above condition is not satisfied
  }
  ```
  * Try if else by drawing different coloured ellipses on different halves of the canvas
  * We can now use the `mouseIsPressed` variable to create interactions when the mouse is pressed
  * NOTE: You can also use the mousePressed() function. Note that there is a huge difference between the mouseIsPressed variable and the mousePressed() function: the variable mousePressed is true as long as any mouse button is pressed, while the function mousePressed() is called only once whenever a mouse button is pressed, no matter how long it's pressed for
  * **TODO** : if mouse is pressed, change the colour of the canvas! (Can pressing in different areas call for different background colours)
  * **TODO** : Continuing on the above, can we make a button?
  * Multiple conditions! In case of multiple conditions, we will use the `else if` conditional
  * **TODO** : can we make multiple buttons?
  * We can use the if statements to now make a bouncing ball!

## Loops
  * Loops are used to repeat code
  * There are 2 kinds of loops we will be looking at - `for` loops and `while` loops.
* For loops
* **TODO**: use while loop to draw 10 ellipses on the screen
* Nested loops
* **TODO**: use while loop to draw 100 ellipses on the screen!
* **Be careful of infinite loops!!**

## Random function
  * `random(x,y)` - gives a random number between x and y.
  * If you want a whole number, you can use `floor(random(x,y))`

## While loops - a quick look (Not covering in class)
  * The syntax for while loops is similar to `if` statement. The main difference is that, in a `if` block, the code inside runs once after the condition is checked. In a `while` loop, the code inside the while block runs as long as the condition is satisfied before leaving the code block.
  ``` 
  while(condition) {
    //code goes here
  }
  ```

* Other Functions we can use!
  * random function 
  * noise function 
  * sin

* Noise function
  * Perlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more naturally ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard random() function.
  * [Perlin noise reference](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noise/)
  * TODO : Make a 1-D perlin noise space to change the size of an ellipse / make a wave
  * TODO : Make a 2-D perlin noise space to get a greyscale screen!

* Sin function
  * You can also use the sin wave to ease animations
  * TODO : make a sine wave (remember, you can use `angleMode(DEGREES)`) 
  * TODO : use it to gradually change the colour/size in your previous sketches

* IF time permits - translation and rotation
