# Images - Part 2
* Using sprites!!
  
## Get function in image
* You can use the get function in 2 ways. If you give it ONLY x and y values, it gives you the rgb value for that single pixel.
* If you give it 4 values - x, y, width, height - it will give you the pixel values of that part of the image. Meaning, you can display it as an image!
* Note: You can display a part of the image using the (image)[https://p5js.org/reference/p5/image/] function, but an easier way to do it would be using the (image.get)[https://p5js.org/reference/p5.Image/get/] function

## Sprites
* A spritesheet has various parts of a charecter animation linearly layed out.
* We can use img.get to break them up into smaller images and the store them in an array
* We can then loop through the array and display the images sequentially to create the illusion of movement
* PS - This is going to be very helpful when you are working with games.
